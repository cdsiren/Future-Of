Project Overview

Based NFTs enables users to purchase NFTs on Base using any token on any chain. Users do not need to worry about bridging tokens over to Base as a pre-requisite for transacting on the network. Based NFTs is equipped with Decent's Box product, which enables cross-chain payments at the point-of-sale. The Box also aggregates secondary listings so listed NFTs never hit a sold out state; users are simply presented the best available ask price on secondary markets.

The goal of Based NFTs is to make it as easy as possible for existing crypto users to start transacting on Base. This site meets users at their point of liquidity to mitigate the cold start problem of launching a new network.

Based NFTs also provides analytics on each collection and overall NFT collecting activity on Base. This site's focuses on analytics to further ease any hesitancy from new users about collecting on a new chain: if you know what you are collecting, whether other people are collecting it, and it's easy to do so -- you're likely to collect.
