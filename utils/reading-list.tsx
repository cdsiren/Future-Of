    date: "2017",
    author: "Simon de la Rouviere",
    excerpt: "Each topic/meme/idea/goal has an associated token of value that is used to curate information inside it.

    title: "Squad Wealth",
    date: "2020",
    author: "Sam Hart",

These not only enable the creation of social capital, but strengthen the squad's capacity to organize, minimizing transaction costs and leading to greater productive capacities and resilience; this is "the nature of the squad." But while squads can be viewed as a "nexus of contracts", unlike the Coasean firm, they are without legal structure. Social contracts are instead effected through the unspoken bonds of mutual respect and ingroup norms.`,

    date: "2022",
    author: "Barnabé Monnot",
    excerpt: `These two items, verifiable settlement and data availability, are critical to secure off-chain execution. The first effectively ensures that theft cannot be committed. The second provides certainty that any attempt to settle stale state can be successfully challenged.  Rollups are off-chain networks built to satisfy both properties.`,

    date: "2012",
    author: "Alejo Salles",
    excerpt: `Where Mt^Positive and Mt^Negative represent number of positive or negative tweets on a particular day t. Logarithm of bullishness measures the share of surplus positive signals and also gives more weight to larger number of messages in a specific sentiment (positive or negative).

The agreement among positive and negative tweet messages is defined by:`,
